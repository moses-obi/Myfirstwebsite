      main features of programming language
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Simplicity: The language must offer
        clear and simple concepts that
        facilitates its learning and the
        application, in way that is simple to
        understand and the maintained.
      </li>
      <li>
        Naturalness: This means that it is the
        application in the area for which it was
        designed must be done naturally,
        providing operators, structures and
        syntax for operators to work
        efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abstraction: it is the ability to define
        and use complicated structures or
        operators while ignoring some details
        ,which influences writing ability.
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
        Efficiency: programming language must be
        translated and executed efficiently to
        minimize memory space and time spent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Structuring: the language allows
        programmers to write their codes
        according to structured programming
        concepts, to avoid creating errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compactness: writing without having to
        write to many details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Locality: this refers to the code
        concentrating on the part of the program
        with which you are working at a given
        time.
      </li>
